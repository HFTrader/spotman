# Web Server Profile
# Modern SpotMan profile that leverages the new regions.yaml configuration system
# This profile demonstrates region-agnostic web server deployment with user data execution

# Instance configuration
instance_type: "t3.small"  # Upgraded from micro for better performance
spot_instance: false  # On-demand instance for production web server reliability
hibernation_enabled: false  # Not needed for web servers

# Storage configuration
root_volume_size: 20  # GB - sufficient for web server and logs
root_volume_type: "gp3"  # Latest generation EBS for better performance

# Operating system configuration
os_type: "ubuntu"
update_os: true  # Automatically update the OS during bootstrap

# User data script - references external script file using native YAML include
user_data: !include scripts/webserver-setup.sh

# Tags for multi-region web server
tags:
  ApplicationClass: "web-server"
  Environment: "production"
  Owner: "web-team"
  MultiRegion: "true"
  Purpose: "web-server-deployment"
  ManagedBy: "spotman"
  
# Notes:
# - This profile uses the new regions.yaml system for region-specific configuration
# - AMI IDs, key names, security groups, and subnets are automatically selected per region
# - User data references external script using native YAML !include directive
# - External scripts are automatically loaded and Base64 encoded by SpotMan
# - SSH configuration is automatically generated with correct key file paths
# - Health check endpoint available at http://instance-ip/health
# - Deployment logs available at /var/log/user-data.log on the instance
#
# YAML Include Features:
# - Native YAML !include directive for external file inclusion
# - Scripts are resolved relative to SpotMan root directory
# - Supports both relative paths (scripts/) and absolute paths
# - Cleaner syntax than manual @include processing
# - Better integration with YAML parsing and validation
#
# Usage examples:
#   ./spotman --region us-east-1 create --profile webserver --name web-east
#   ./spotman --region eu-west-1 create --profile webserver --name web-eu
#   ./spotman --region sa-east-1 create --profile webserver --name web-sa
